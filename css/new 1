Note: Currently like as on Chrome for Android and other browsers on Android, there’s no inbuilt prompt to show Add to Homescreen for iOS devices.
 Due to that reason you need to manually add the PWA to your Homescreen.
Tap the Share button (at the browser options)
From the options tap the Add to Homescreen option, you can notice an icon of the website or screenshot of website added to your devices homescreen instantly.
